## Overview
This MERN stack application serves as a template for building full-stack web applications. It integrates MongoDB for the database, Express.js and Node.js for the server-side logic, and React.js for the client-side user interface.

## Technologies Used
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js used for building the server-side logic.
- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for running server-side logic.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework used for styling the application.

## Environment Variables
Before running the application, make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Specify the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

- `PORT`: Port number on which the server will run.
- `MONGO_URI`: URI for connecting to your MongoDB database.
- `SECRET`: Secret key used for encrypting and decrypting data (e.g., JWT tokens).

Example `.env` file:
- PORT=5000
- MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://shaveenleousj:3p7pGAMm5d2lks9C@cluster0.k5rj4uw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
- SECRET=mysecretkey

## Setup Instructions
To set up the application locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd <project-directory>

3. Install dependencies for the server:
cd client
npm install

4. Install dependencies for the client:
cd frontend
npm install

5. Start the server:
node index.js
   
6. Start the client:
npm run dev

7. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.


## Styling
Styling for this application is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS classes are used directly in the React components to style the user interface.

For more information about Tailwind CSS, visit [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

That's it! You should now have the MERN stack application up and running locally on your machine. Happy coding! ðŸš€
